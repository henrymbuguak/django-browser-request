# How to Capture Browser Request and save to Database
This is a very simple project where we get user ip address, browser, content type 
and query string from Django request.

## Getting Started
The following instruction will help you set up the project as a developer.

### Prerequisites
```
Install Python 3.6 
```

```
Create a virtual environment
```


```
Make sure your virtualenvironment is activated everytime you work on this project
```

### Managing Dependencies
To clone the project, run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/henrymbuguak/django-browser-request.git
```

After cloning the project, on your terminal navigate to project base folder (where requirements.txt is)
To install dependencies run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration File
Django uses settings.py files for configuration. Do not edit this file, instead create 
a file named local_settings.py in the folder where settings.py is located and copy 
everything that is located inside settings.py apart from the last lines which start
with try. 

Every time you want to change configuration use local_settings.py

### Running Migrations
Before you can run the project in development environment, you need to set up the 
migration. To create initial migration run the following command:


```
python manage.py makemigrations browser_request
```

To sync you migration with the sqlite database use the following command:
```
python manage.py migrate
```

### Development Server
To launch django development server, run the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Once the development server is running successfully, to capture the user request 
data visit this url: 

* [http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/browser/data](http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/browser/data) 

To view the data in json, created using django rest framework, visit:
